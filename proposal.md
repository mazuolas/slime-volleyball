# Slime Volleyball

## Background

Slime volleyball is a simple browser game where players control a slime to hit a ball across a net.  When the ball lands on your side of the court, your opponent gets a point.  The winner of a match is the first player to get 7 points.

## Functionality and MVP

My version of slime volleyball will have the following:

* controlling the slimes using a keyboard
* ball bouncing physics
* tracking score and starting a new game
* Single player vs AI
* Two player using wasd and arrow keys
* production readme

## Wireframes

This app will have a single page where the player will first choose between 1 or 2 players.  The current score will be displayed on the top of the court and the controls will be on the bottom.
